# SML_lead_prediction

This project aims to make a movie prediction model to determine if the lead actor is female or male.

The structure is as follows:
- analyzing the data and answering several important questions about it;
- implementation of four different models: logistic regression, discriminant analysis (LDA and QDA), k-nearest-neighbors, and tree-based methods;
- comparison and selection of the model most suitable for the purpose.
